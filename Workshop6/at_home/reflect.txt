1) We should avoid using friend operators because friends
   stab you in the back :). Friend operators are used
   when the operator needs to acess the class member
   variables and function, or else they are useless.

2) yes you can by, refferencing the object and putting
   the operator in the class to create a member operator.

3) the operator+= looks at the right and left for any
   numbers or objects being implemmented into the main.
   Therefore the += takes the right hand number, adds it
   by itself and equals it to the left object.
