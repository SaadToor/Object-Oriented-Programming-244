1) A safe empty state ensures that the variables start
with nothing for memory allocation, or if a statment
is false then the data gets set to 0.

a) The setEmpty() function is the safe empty state,
which is also being used in the constructor.

b) I selected this state to make the variables that are
false to 0, so that it will not overload the program.


2) Having multiple constructors helps the clients, becuase
one consturctor can have a safe empty state and the others
can have values passed into them. Rather than having one
constructor that passes the values and does a safe empty
state.
