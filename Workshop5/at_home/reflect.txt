1) allocateAndCopy() function is used to validate if the information
being entered is not null in  the isVaild() function. If the function
is true then the function copies all the data from the user to the
member variables.

2) A copy constructor is needed because when the user enters data and
wants to store it into a different class without losing it. Becuase,
when performing memory allcocation, all the data gets deleted after the destructor.But, 
using copy constructor the data gets stored.
