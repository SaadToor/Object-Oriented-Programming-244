1)  Virtual Methods are methods in the a base class that you can override 
    in derived classes.

2)  Virutal methods need to be implemented, where as pure virtual methods
    dont need to be implemented.

3)  A Abstract class is a class which contains more than one abstract 
    method(is declaired but not implemented). They where useful because 
    the base class, Vehicle, had the methods, and was inherited by Car,
    which was then inherited by the other two classes. Then the two 
    methods were changed in the two classes that inherited Car.

4)  A class that only contains pure virtual methods is known as a 
    interface. They were useful, because inheriting the interface class 
    Vehicle allowed me to change the pure virtual functions. 

5)  No, because a abstarct class contains more than one abstract method, 
    where as, a interface class contains pure virtual methods.
